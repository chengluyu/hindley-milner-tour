# A Tour of Hindley Milner Type System

This repository holds my implementation of a Hindley-Milner type system and corresponding type inference algorithm.

## Memorandum

- [ ] Finish basic infrastructure of the type system
- [ ] Finish the basic inference algorithm (either constraint-based or substitution-based)
- [ ] Implement inference on recursive functions
- [ ] Implement inference on mutually recursive functions
- [ ] Make an online REPL single-page application and host it on GitHub pages
